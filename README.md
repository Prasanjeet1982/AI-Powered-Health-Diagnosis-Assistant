## Features
- **Symptom-Based Diagnosis:** Input a list of symptoms to get predicted health condition diagnoses.
- **Random Forest and SVM Models:** Utilize both Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models for diagnosis.
- **FastAPI Web Interface:** Interact with the assistant through a user-friendly web interface.
- **Docker Support:** Easily containerize and deploy the application using Docker.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/health-diagnosis-assistant.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd health-diagnosis-assistant
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Start the FastAPI application:
   ```
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```
2. Access the web interface by visiting `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
3. Enter the symptoms, and the assistant will predict potential health conditions using advanced ML models.

Please note that this is a simplified demonstration and should not be used for actual medical diagnosis. The dataset and models used are for educational purposes only.
